# What's Down There?
"What's down there?"

"We don't know, we're just going to poke around and find out."

I knew this was a half baked scheme going in, but I didn't realize it would be this bad. In the wake of destruction rought by the TITANS, it was hard to imagine landing anywhere on Earth without a clear objective. From the swarms of nanomachines, to the super viruses and other environmental toxins, to kill bots that still wander loooking for prey, it's hard to imagine making a trip to just "poke around and find out". Either our client knew something we didn't or we were making a grave mistake.

As the dropship broke the through the cloud cover of the super cell rolling through, the view was still breathtaking. Despite being one of the most hostile wastelands in the solar system, there also was no where else where water fell from the sky and vegetation readily sprung from the ground. The sprawling greenery that had taken over the ruins of the city below us was unlike anything I had ever seen. Growing up on the small colony vessels that dot the asteroid belt, you get used to the inhospital nature of walls carved of rock separating you from cold lifeless void. But here, once you could walk under an open sky and freely breathe the air. At one point anyway.

"Where are we setting down?"

"Pick somewhere close to the ground, we're going into the old subway system."

"What's down there?"

I didn't like the idea of being trapped underground in an unknown environment. It was easy to imaginge getting lost in the maze of tunnels while being hunted by god knows what.

"Like I said, we're going to poke around and find out."

Looking for a clearing, we find one on the old highway that ran over the city. As the dropship landed, we sealed our environmental suits. Although the atmosphere once would have made this planet a paradise, the various plagues made an environmental suit a must. Designed in some biolab, long ago, no one knows what there original purpose was. Now though, they've poisoned the air more efficiently than any chemical weapon could.

"Check your seals before we go out, I don't want any of you bringing anything unwanted back."

We stepped into the airlock, and with a hiss the door sealed behind us. After a few seconds, the door in front us opened to reveal the ruins of the city in front of us. The decaying husks of old automobiles, some with the skeletal remains of their passengers still inside, literred the street. We also felt the full 1G of Earths gravity as we moved. Our exoskeletons compensated for the extra strain it would place on our bodies born in space, but we still felt the weight of our bodies.

After securing our grapples to the old infrastructure we dropped off the side of the overpass. The planters that once held the manicured trees of city side walks, now contained massive overgrown behemoths that tore and cracked the sidewalk.

"How far?"

"Half a mile north-west."

You walk, slowly achingly putting one foot in front of the next. You're all that's left. You need to survive. You need to tell them, warn them.
