# Experiments
Repo of a bunch of different experimental things. Feel free to dig.

## Summary
Most of the stuff in here is a some mix of Python, GCode (Godot), markdown notes, and other things. I've put it here, so I can access it from different places as well as organize it a little more.

### GenericRPG
Generic RPG game elements testing ground. Testing different implementations of different things to see what I like and what works and what does not.
### MathGame
Math based education game with math operations being elemental powers.
### Ideas
Random ideas that are floating around in my brain. Maybe they will become games, maybe I'll just use it as a writing exercise.
